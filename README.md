## Fun Fact

Did you know In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue made history by defeating the reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. It was a groundbreaking moment as it marked the first time a reigning world champion lost a match to a computer under standard chess tournament time controls. Deep Blue's victory showcased the rapid progress of AI in mastering complex strategic games like chess?
